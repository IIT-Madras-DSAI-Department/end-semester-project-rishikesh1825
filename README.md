# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.


* This repository has the complete implementation of the predicting the labels of MNIST_validation.csv upon training the various models on ML_train.csv .
* There are 3 files in total. 2 .py files and 1 pdf .
* In the Algorithms_ML_lab.py there are all the algorithms or models that I tried on and the best model is used in the Main_training.py .

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

* I have submitted 3 files in total.
* 2 .py files, names Algorithms_ML_lab.py and Main_training.py.
* And a pdf named ML-lab-endsem-report

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Install the below packages if not already installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn.metrics
* matplotlib.pyplot
* time

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* Download both the .py files and place them in the same folder as the datasets, so that you can run the code directly without mentioning the file paths.
* And then install the above packages if they are not already installed.

## You can further add your own sections/titles along with corresponding contents here:
